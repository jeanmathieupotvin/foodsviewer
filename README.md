# FoodsViewer

A private and secure front-end interface to the
[digest](https://github.com/jeanmathieupotvin/digest) package.

First and foremost built for me and my girlfriend.

# Description

FoodsViewer is a responsive web application to better visualize results stemming from Viome 
Gut Intelligence TestÂ® kits. It uses the data structures of
[digest](https://github.com/jeanmathieupotvin/digest) to better combine results of a couple,
here **mine**. It is a **private** application. You cannot sign up, and you cannot use it. This
is because I am not affiliated to ViomeÂ® in any way. For more information on this, see section
[Disclaimer](#Disclaimer) below.

# Why is this code public?

Because you can easily clone this project, deploy it and use it privately, just like I do. I
made my best to make it production ready. Note that you will have to go through the following
steps before deploying.

1. Create a private, untracked, `crypt/` folder. This folder will contain your users' information
and data (basically JSON files containing unparsed `digest::FoodCollection`).

2. Create a private, untracked, `.env` file with some secret `SESSION_TOKEN` environment
variable. Make it random, really long, and **hide it** at all costs. You will also have to
set a second environment variable `NODE_ENV` equal to `'development'` or `'production'`.

3. Compile the production versions of the CSS and JS scripts with the `npm` commands defined in
`package.json`.

4. Create a `private/images/foods` folder, and populate it with images of all the foods included in
your `digest::FoodCollection`(s). Make sure that names passed to all `Food::imgFile` match the names
of your foods' images.

5. Finally, publish to the web, in one click. (Anyone else tired of these annoying YouTube's
*Webflow* ads?)

# Implementation

This web application is an Express application embedded into a single [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
process. It uses

* [EJS](https://ejs.co/) as its templating system;
* [memorystore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/memorystore) to store sessions' IDs and cookies on the server;
* [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) to manipulate sensible information such as passwords;
* [Passport](https://http://www.passportjs.org/) for the authentication strategy;
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) to build CSS files;
* [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) to minify CSS files and
* [UglifyJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-js) to compress and minify client-side JS scripts.

The code is straightforward, follows usual Express conventions, and is well documented. It won't
be complicated to adapt, I guarantee it. ðŸ˜„ðŸŒˆ

No ViomeÂ® data is exposed by FoodsViewer. It assumes that each user builds its own application and its

time to actually give me some feedback, I would really appreciate it. It is always reassuring to have
someone else look at your code. Thanks!
